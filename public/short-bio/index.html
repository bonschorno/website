    <p>Here&rsquo;s a brief overview of my professional journey so far. For each job, I have summarized what I <em>did</em>. If you&rsquo;re interested in what I <em>learned</em> doing these jobs, I&rsquo;ve written up some of my learnings in the long bio.</p>

<p><em>Apr 2024 – present | Switzerland</em></p>
<p>At GHE, I write papers and grants in various fields, teach students <a href="https://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=183181&amp;semkez=2024W&amp;ansicht=LEHRVERANSTALTUNGEN">what it means to be an international engineer</a>, and conduct research on <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/14967537">maize fertilizer in Malawi</a>.

</h3>
<p><em>Apr 2022 – Oct 2023 | Nigeria &amp; Mali</em></p>
<p>At IMPACT, I was responsible for the data pipelines behind multi-sectoral needs assessments (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/northwest-nigeria-2022-multi-sector-needs-assessment-msna-january-2023">Nigeria in 2022</a> and <a href="https://repository.impact-initiatives.org/document/impact/e3da033c/REACH_MLI_2023-MSNA-BULLETIN-1.pdf">Mali in 2023</a>). This meant I developed sampling strategies, programmed surveys (with Kobo), monitored data quality during the assessments, and supervised my team&rsquo;s analysis of the results.</p>

<p><em>Sep 2019 - Apr 2022 | Switzerland</em></p>
<p>At the SEP, I set up all the surveys (in Qualtrics) and developed a software package (<a href="https://github.com/bonschorno/sep">sep</a>) to automate data visualizations for our <a href="https://istp.ethz.ch/research/sep.html">reports</a>.</p>

<p><em>Oct 2018 - Apr 2019 | Ecuador</em></p>
<p>While working for CSF in Ecuador, I helped organize gastronomy courses and relaunch a <a href="https://cuisinesansfrontieres.ch/de/was-wir-tun/hier-sind-wir-taetig/choco-samona">chocolate cooperative</a> together with a Quechua community.</p>

<p><em>Feb 2017 - Feb 2022 | Switzerland</em></p>
<p>Working as a research assistant for <a href="https://www.unige.ch/sciences-societe/speri/membres/professeures-et-professeurs/template-pp-prof-21/">Prof. Thomas Sattler</a>, I helped him program and analyze online surveys to better understand the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12865">political economy behind austerity</a>.</p>

<p>A mix of history, political science, economics, and law. Living in Geneva was great; the program itself, not so much.</p>

  Languages
  <a class="anchor" href="#languages">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Swiss) German: My mother tongue.</li>
<li>English: The foreign language I speak best. I use it every day for work, writing, and reading.</li>
<li>French: The foreign language I like speaking the most. I&rsquo;ve been with the language for more than half my life, though I only truly learned it during my undergrad. I speak it fluently and wish I could use it every single day.</li>
<li>Italian: I&rsquo;ve always had a passion for Italian but never really learned it. Then, in 2019, I had no choice and had to learn it for my apprenticeship in Italy and never looked back. I can have a conversation, but I wish I spoke it better.</li>
<li>Spanish: I learned it in high school and spoke it fluently while working in Ecuador, but unfortunately, it got a little rusty over the years. Whenever I listen to old salsa songs, I think I should practice it again.</li>
