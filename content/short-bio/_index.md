Here's a brief overview of my professional journey so far. For each job, I have summarized what I *did*. If you're interested in what I *learned* doing these jobs, I've written up some of my learnings in the long bio.

### Scientific Collaborator @ Global Health Engineering

*Apr 2024 – present | Switzerland*

At GHE, I write papers and grants in various fields, teach students [what it means to be an international engineer](https://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=183181&semkez=2024W&ansicht=LEHRVERANSTALTUNGEN), and conduct research on [maize fertilizer in Malawi](https://zenodo.org/records/14967537). I also support team members with data management, statistical analysis, and the computational reproducibility of their work.

### Senior Data Officer @ IMPACT Initiatives

*Apr 2022 – Oct 2023 | Nigeria & Mali*

At IMPACT, I was responsible for the data pipelines behind multi-sectoral needs assessments ([Nigeria in 2022](https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/northwest-nigeria-2022-multi-sector-needs-assessment-msna-january-2023) and [Mali in 2023](https://repository.impact-initiatives.org/document/impact/e3da033c/REACH_MLI_2023-MSNA-BULLETIN-1.pdf)). This meant I developed sampling strategies, programmed surveys (with Kobo), monitored data quality during the assessments, and supervised my team's analysis of the results.

### Research Assistant @ Swiss Environmental Panel

*Sep 2019 - Apr 2022 | Switzerland*

At the SEP, I set up all the surveys (in Qualtrics) and developed a software package ([sep](https://github.com/bonschorno/sep)) to automate data visualizations for our [reports](https://istp.ethz.ch/research/sep.html).

### Pizzaiolo @ Palazzo Margherita

*Jul 2019 - Aug 2019 | Italy*

In the summer of 2019, I had the amazing opportunity to learn the craft of pizzamaking in Southern Italy.

### Staff @ Cuisine sans frontières

*Oct 2018 - Apr 2019 | Ecuador*

While working for CSF in Ecuador, I helped organize gastronomy courses and relaunch a [chocolate cooperative](https://cuisinesansfrontieres.ch/de/was-wir-tun/hier-sind-wir-taetig/choco-samona) together with a Quechua community.

### Research Assistant @ University of Geneva

*Feb 2017 - Feb 2022 | Switzerland*

Working as a research assistant for [Prof. Thomas Sattler](https://www.unige.ch/sciences-societe/speri/membres/professeures-et-professeurs/template-pp-prof-21/), I helped him program and analyze online surveys to better understand the [political economy behind austerity](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12865).

## Education

### Comparative and International Studies @ ETH Zurich

A fancy name for a political science program with a focus on research and quantitative methods. I really liked it.

### International Relations (BARI) @ University of Geneva

A mix of history, political science, economics, and law. Living in Geneva was great; the program itself, not so much.

## Languages

* (Swiss) German: My mother tongue.
* English: The foreign language I speak best. I use it every day for work, writing, and reading.
* French: The foreign language I like speaking the most. I've been with the language for more than half my life, though I only truly learned it during my undergrad. I speak it fluently and wish I could use it every single day.
* Italian: I've always had a passion for Italian but never really learned it. Then, in 2019, I had no choice and had to learn it for my apprenticeship in Italy and never looked back. I can have a conversation, but I wish I spoke it better.
* Spanish: I learned it in high school and spoke it fluently while working in Ecuador, but unfortunately, it got a little rusty over the years. Whenever I listen to old salsa songs, I think I should practice it again.
